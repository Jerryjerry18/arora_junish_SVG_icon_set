# NEW SKILLS ONE THE WAY
Happy with the project , assisted some CSS and tried to simple  transitions   and worked for very first time with java (loved the way site responded)


MIT LICENSE UPDATED 

WITH UPDATION OF README FILE

TRIED SOME CSS ANIMATION WITH HEADING TAGS AND THEN ADDED SOME KIND OF ANIMATIONS AND HOVER EFFECTS TO THE SVG's ICONS 

ALSO TRIED ALL THE ID WITH CONSOLES AND HAPPY HOW THEY ACTUALLY RESPONDED WITH THE TAPS AND CLICK ON THE ELEMENTS


look forward to grab as much as I can in this course and would love to indulge more iinto these sort of assignments
